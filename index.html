      <h3>Phil Burton</h3>
      <ul>

      <li>Show: Human Nature Sings Motown & More</li>
      
        <li>Location: The Venetian Resort / Sands Showroom</li>
      
          <li>Years in show: 10</li>
      
            <li> Home town: Sydney, Australia</li>
    </ul>
      <p>Background training/education: All of us have had singing lessons at various times in our life, as well as a few dance lessons here and there, but nothing formal. The closest thing to formal instruction we received was being part of a school-based entertainment training workshop called the “Talent Development Project” which gave talented young performers a basic grounding in things such as stagecraft, repertoire choices and other facets of live performance.
      
      Passions outside of work: Golf - the trick is finding time to pursue it!</p>
      
      <p>Favorite things to do in Vegas: Having a glass of wine at the front bar of Mon Ami Gabi. It’s great for people and fountain watching, and you don’t have to wait ages for a balcony table.</p>
      
     <p> Most memorable/satisfying moment in the show: Most of our audience have never heard of us or what we do before they see the show, so it’s a nightly challenge for us to convert these people into fans. It’s always a wonderful moment when you can sense the crowd are all on your side, and are really having a great time.  </p>

        built a waterfall, pond, stone fireplace, mini pitch and putting

        other shows and entertainment in Las Vegas. I love going to shows!</p>


        <p class="graph"><strong>Most memorable moment in my show:</strong> When I got to introduce my mom
        and dad, Arlene and John Sawchuk, in the audience for the first time in my 
        Las Vegas show at the Tropicana Laugh Factory. It was a "look mom
        and dad I made it!" moment. Someone captured that exact time when I
        walked into the audience to give them both a hug and a kiss, and that photo
        hangs on my wall in my house today. It means even more to me now, after
        losing my Dad 4 years ago. Mom and dad were married 54 years!</p>

<p class="graph"><strong> Background training/education: </strong> My mom taught at a local dance studio, Fern Adair’s Conservatory of the Arts, so I was trained there in ballet, jazz, tap, modern, and Pas de Deux. I did 10 years of Vegas shows, musicals, tours, and cruise ships before joining Chippendales!</p>
<p class="graph"><strong> Passions outside of work: </strong>One of my biggest passions is music, but that’s not really outside of work anymore because they let me play my guitar in the show!  But I’d say traveling is my next biggest passion. If there’s a chance to see a new area of the world and a new culture, I’m always down!!
</p>
<p class="graph"><strong> Favorite thing to do in Vegas: </strong>I think since my job involves the most “Vegas-y” parts of Vegas (being near the strip, loud party music, etc), my favorite things to do here are surprisingly normal. Find a new niche restaurant, go to the corner bar, see a movie at a lux theater. I like my life outside of the show to be fairly pedestrian.  </p>
<p class="graph"><strong> Most memorable/satisfying moment in the show: </strong>As much as there’s incredible moments every night ON the stage, the memories of the show I hold dearest happen BEHIND the stage. I couldn’t ask for a better group of guys to work with. They truly are the brothers I’ve never had, and the amount of fun we have backstage is nearly criminal. I’ve never once walked out of that show in a worse mood than I walked in with. It’s amazing!

At 15 years old, I decided to finish my high school training at The Harid Conservatory. From there I had the wonderful opportunity to gain experience and dance with the Colorado Ballet, Ballet West and Festival Ballet Providence. I attended a summer intensive in 2015 at Nederlands Dans Theatre that changed my life and perspective on dance. </p>
                <p class="graph"><strong> Passions outside of work: </strong>I absolutely love music, going to live shows, supporting my fellow performer/entertainer friends in other shows around Vegas, and exploring all the new and exciting things that Vegas has to offer.</p>
                <p class="graph"><strong> Favorite thing to do in Vegas: </strong>My favorite thing to do in Vegas, hands down, is take advantage of the never-ending offerings of live shows. I never turn down an invitation to attend a show. I think I’ve seen The Beatles LOVE almost 10 times! </p>
                <p class="graph"><strong> Most memorable/satisfying moment in the show: </strong>I will never forget the curtain going up at The Smith Center (my favorite theatre I have performed in to date, and I’m so incredibly lucky to be able to perform there) at the opening of George Balanchine’s Serenade. The company last performed it in the fall of 2017. The opening image that is revealed includes the entire female corps de ballet. It is so stunning, and the audience immediately began to applaud. In that moment, a tear streamed down my face and I could not have been happier. I was so proud and excited. I knew I was exactly where I needed to be. </p>

                                    worked with many different shows and did many different disciplines,

                                    was a clown, but didn’t want to pursue this path since it is viewed as
                                    a stereotype for little person like me. Didn’t want to be funny. I
                                    wanted to do something unique and different.

                            clowns. I’m very much an observer. I never took well to classes or
                            even workshops in the past. I’m someone who just kind of needs to go

                            collector. When I joined Clown Bar I did a deep dive on Emmett Kelly
                            and “Weary Willie,” to whom my Dusty is obviously a direct nod, and
                            that led to an appreciation of clowning as an art, and of its place in
                            history. Then I feel like I’m going on stage with some context.

                            history of Las Vegas fascinates me so much. I’ll spend all day in the
                            Mob Museum or exploring a barren ghost town if you leave me to it.

                            perform at Majestic Rep. There’s an energy in that space you don’t
                            feel anywhere else. As an independently run storefront theatre it
                            encompasses the best of what that distinction implies. It’s gritty,
                            it’s grassroots, and when you’re there you feel like your witness to
                            the beginning of a larger vision. Troy Heard challenges his actors as
                            well as his audiences in the tradition of so many groundbreaking

                                    or taking my pup on an adventure, I am somewhere in Las Vegas working
                                    on "band stuff." Sounds pretty rock 'n roll when I say it like that...
                                    but I love writing and playing music with these boys more than I can say.
                                    Can't wait to bring them out to Vegas and show Sin City how we do it.

                                    to town, my favorite thing to do in Vegas is search for the best dive
                                    bar and the best pizza. So far, Double Down Saloon has my heart, but
                                    I’m still in search for that pizza that will hit the spot when I'm feeling
                                    homesick. Other than that, Market in the Alley in downtown is
                                    incredible, especially Excuse Moi, which is a speakeasy with a silent
                                    disco inside. It’s heaven.

                                    the show that gets me every night. The first is in the opening number;
                                    I'm surrounded by the guys right before the beat of the next song
                                    drops and it feels like we are gearing up to go into battle. For a
                                    moment, it is about us and the show, and I feel powerful as hell. The
                                    second is at the end of the show, before my final exit, when I get to
                                    have a sincere, albeit cheeky, moment with my fellow queens in the
                                    audience. Even though we are having a laugh, I get to remind them that
                                    who they are, just as they are, is enough. Again, in empowering other
                                    women, I get to feel powerful too.
